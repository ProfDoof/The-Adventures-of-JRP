To compile you will need to type 
g++ -Wall -std=gnu++0x test.cpp -o adventure
into the terminal while in the file.

You will start in a room. Due to the current lack of item functionality you will want to use the command "d" to activate debug mode.

To show that movement works type "n".

Type "n".

This will activate combat, you can either use the run function by typing "r" or the attack function by using "a". Since you should be currently in debug mode you shouldn't ever be able to lose. If you want to test the death functionality follow these instructions

"n","n","a","e","e","a" and you should be dead.

To test the look functionality at any point type "l".

To test the current stat function type "q".
